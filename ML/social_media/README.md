# Social Media Addiction vs. Relationships â€” Data Analysis & ML Modeling

This project explores the relationship between social media addiction and real-life relationships using a publicly available dataset. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and possible predictors of social media overuse and its effect on emotional and social behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset by Adil Shamim](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships)
- **License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
- **Collection Methodology**: One-time online survey administered in Q1 2025.
- **Content**: Includes responses to questions measuring social media use, addiction tendencies, and relational impacts.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Preprocess the data (cleaning, handling missing values, encoding)
- Train machine learning models to:
  - Predict addiction levels
  - Classify respondents' relationship impact
- Visualize correlations and behavioral patterns

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## ðŸ§¼ Preprocessing

- Removed null and inconsistent entries
- Converted categorical responses to numerical formats
- Normalized key features for modeling

## ðŸ§  Models

We experimented with:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM
- XGBoost

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy on predicting social media addiction levels.
- Strong negative correlation observed between addiction and relationship satisfaction.
