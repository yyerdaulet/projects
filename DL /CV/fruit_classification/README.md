# Fruit Classification using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of fruits â€” specifically, apples and strawberries.

## Project Summary

The goal is to build and train a CNN model that can distinguish between apples and strawberries based on image input. The model is trained on labeled data, evaluated, and can be used for inference on new fruit images.
